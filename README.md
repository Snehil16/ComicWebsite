## Project Description

The "Lifetime of a Plastic Bottle" project is a comic strip that explores the impact of plastic bottles on the environment. The overarching concept of the project is to showcase how plastic bottles continue to linger around for years, adding to the existing garbage in the environment.

We tried to achieve this by depicting the plastic bottle in the same location, while the rest of the city around it develops and changes over time. The theme of the project is centered on environmental awareness and encouraging responsible waste management.

The comic's ultimate goal is to create an engaging and educational experience for users, encouraging them to understand the impact of plastic bottles on the environment. The comic uses images and visual storytelling to convey the message effectively. We also included a button with a description of each panel to help users better understand the story and the message being conveyed.

The comic strives to create an emotional connection with the viewers, making them understand the harm that plastic bottles cause to the environment. It aims to create a sense of responsibility among users to dispose of plastic bottles properly and encourages them to adopt sustainable practices in their everyday lives.

## Process

### Coding 

We decided to use JavaScript libraries (GSAP and Scrollmagic animation libraries)  because Abraiz had already used them for a previous homework, and we decided that using a library we are familiar with would be a good call both in terms of saving time, as well as a better look for the website itself. We divided each panel into its own ‘timeline’ and decided what needed to ‘slide in’ and when. We wanted to have the user interact with the website to develop the story, so we decided to make the user ‘drink’ and ‘throw’ the bottle so they can feel as though the story is a consequence to their action - adding to the message. The first scroll is activated by clicking the bottle, then the rest of the scrolls need to be done by the user (as instructed). Another interaction we added was the buttons to make the text appear and disappear as the user sees fit.

### Asset Making Process (Illustrator)

The process of creating assets for a project can be a challenging task, especially when the goal is to achieve a consistent aesthetic across multiple elements. In this particular case, we had difficulties finding suitable options online or through AI-generated tools. As a result, we decided to use Adobe Illustrator to create each image in a separate layer, which would allow for the smooth functioning of the scroll animation.
To make the asset creation process more efficient, we designed the assets in a way that they could be reused in creating different layers. For instance, we used a building asset and reversed it, then attached it to the original asset to create a new building altogether. This approach not only saves time and effort but also ensures that the final product has a cohesive look and feel.

## Reflection/Evaluation

We kept the initial planning quite minimalistic in terms of the wireframe. We began with only the idea of the panels and the script, and then we decided to make the website as we saw fit once we started programming. We fleshed out the panels quite well before we started coding and this helped us a lot since when it came to the coding we had the story and panels planned out, we simply needed to implement them. We initially only had the first 2 panels be interactive with sound and clicking, but after some reflection, we decided to focus our storytelling mostly through the pictures. We got the idea from “Understanding Comics: the Invisible Art” by Scott McCloud, in chapter 6 “Show and Tell” one of the ideas he mentions is about how comics should tell a lot of the story through pictures and not text - hence they need to “show” what is happening and not just “tell” it, hence why we decided to implement buttons to add and remove the text as the user sees fit. We ensured that the idea can be perceived without any text at all, but that the text is also not useless and that it adds a lot of emotional charge to the story itself. Another reason why we decided to put so much work into creating the artwork was because we all come from Computer Science background, and we are taking this class to challenge ourselves creatively and to develop the creative side of our career field, that is why we pushed ourselves to rely so much on the artwork itself, and keep the website design minimalistic. Most of the coding work went into adding onto the artwork itself - such as adding sounds, ‘slide in’ and layering effects, and interactive buttons.

We faced a few challenges while working with the libraries, which had to be solved with other JavaScript code, but the internet came in handy as always and helped us solve them. One such problem was the “whooshing” sound when the bottle is thrown, because initially our idea made it so that the whooshing sound kept playing after the scrolling point, or that it only plays once each time the page is loaded. We fixed this by implementing a range of scroll Y values as a condition for the sound to play.

Another challenge we faced was to keep consistency in our paintings, which is why we decided to divide each item into layers and reuse the same items in the panels to keep consistency. This also later helped with the “slide in and out” effects on the website, where we had to make decisions to where the focus of the user should be. We used the effect to draw the attention to the necessary items that needed to stick out in that particular panel.
Decisions such as these which were made throughout the developing process made the transition from just panels or just a story to a web-based comic. The story itself is intentionally emotional, because the message is one that we hope sticks with the user and encourages them to make better decisions for our environment going forward.
